  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented on the frontend by always returning a non-empty seeded fallback list for work items and logging backend fetch errors to the console, preventing an error-only UI state. REQ-2 embedding support for YouTube (including Shorts) and external-link behavior is implemented at the component/URL-parsing level, but the diff does not provide evidence that the specific user-provided YouTube URLs were actually added as work items (e.g., in the seeded list).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add the user-provided YouTube video links as work items under the My Work section title 'My Work' and render them as embedded videos.",
      "reason": "While YouTube/Shorts URL detection and embedding infrastructure is present, the diff does not show where the specific provided URLs are inserted as work items (e.g., the contents of SEEDED_WORK_ITEMS / seedWorkItems). Without that evidence, it cannot be verified that those exact five URLs will appear in the My Work section.",
